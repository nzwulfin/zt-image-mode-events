== Launch bootc-image-builder

To this point, we’ve been dealing with standard OCI images and tools.
However, bootc images are intended to be systems, not run like
application containers.

To boot this image as a host, we install it to the filesystem using
`+bootc+`. But `+bootc+` doesn’t know anything about creating disks or
machines.

There are several ways to deploy a bootc image to a host, depending on
the target environment. For the purposes of this lab, we’ll create a
QCOW2 image to be run on a KVM virtual machine. To build the QCOW2 image
we’ll use a tool called `+bootc-image-builder+`.

____
[!NOTE] This operation will take about 4 minutes to complete.

[source,bash,run,subs=attributes+]
----
podman run --rm --privileged \
        --volume .:/output \
        --volume ./config.json:/config.json \
        --volume /var/lib/containers/storage:/var/lib/containers/storage \
        registry.redhat.io/rhel10/bootc-image-builder:10.0 \
        --type qcow2 \
        --config config.json \
         builder.{guid}.{domain}:5000/test-bootc

This tool is a containerized version of image builder that includes the
`+bootc+` tooling to unpack the container image contents to the virtual
disk. Supported output formats include AMIs and VMDKs. For bare metal,
we can use Anaconda with `+bootc+` support to install to physical disk.
Other typical ways we’d install a RHEL host, like over PXE or HTTP Boot
are also available to us.

When building, `+bootc-image-builder+` uses the image directly from
disk. Since it requires elevated privileges (eg needs to be run as root)
for certain operations, the image needs to be in the system storage
location. If the original build was done as a normal user, the image can
be copied to system storage using `+podman image scp+`.

== Prepare and run the bootc image

To launch a KVM guest, copy the QCOW2 disk image we created to the
default libvirt storage pool.

[source,bash,run]
----
cp qcow2/disk.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/bootc-vm.qcow2
----

Using `+virt-install+` we can define a simple VM and import the new disk
image.

[source,bash,run]
----
virt-install --name bootc-vm \
--disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/bootc-vm.qcow2 \
--import \
--memory 2048 \
--graphics none \
--osinfo rhel9-unknown \
--noautoconsole \
--noreboot
----

Once the VM has been defined, we can start it.

[source,bash,run]
----
virsh start bootc-vm
----

== SSH to the VM running our bootc image

Next, log into the VM. Switch to the link:tab-1[button label="`VM SSH
session`" background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] tab.

____
{empty}[!NOTE] If the SSH session hasn’t connected or there is an error,
you can reconnect by clicking Refresh next to the tab name. The prompt
will look like this.

Once the system has finished booting, you can log in with the following
credentials. These were injected by `+bootc-image-builder+` when
creating the disk image. There are several ways to handle user creation
and authentication methods, customizing the disk image with
`+bootc-image-builder+` is just one.

Log into the vm with the following credentials.

The initial image included Apache, so let’s check on it’s status

[source,bash,run]
----
systemctl status httpd --no-pager
----

The output will look like this.

Let’s check if the editor `+vim+` was installed.

[source,bash,run]
----
which vim
----

Somehow, we missed installing our standard editor!

Let’s add vim to our image in the next step
